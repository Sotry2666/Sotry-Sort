# Sotry-Sort
A sort algorithm I created using dictionary pairs, recursion, and insertion. After investigating, I found out it is very similar to Ford-Johnson algorithm (Merge-Insertion sort)
Only works with unduplicated input values

Time Complexity:
Best: Θ(n log n)
Worst: Θ(n^2)
Average: Θ(n^2)

Space complexity: Θ(n)
